            Cannabinoids are a class of chemical compounds the cannabis plant
            naturally produces. CBD, or Cannabidiol, is one of the compounds
            found in the Cannabis plant. The other well-known compound is
            tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). THC and CBD are both Cannabinoids,
            occurring naturally in the cannabis plant. Hemp and Marijuana are
            two very different strains of the cannabis plant.{" "}

            CBD can be extracted from marijuana flowers or from hemp leaves.
            While marijuana plants contain high levels of THC, hemp plants
            produce more CBD and contain less than 0.3% THC. This single
            difference is what distinguishes hemp from marijuana. So, just to be
            clear, our CBD comes from the hemp plant ONLY.

            Your body produces its own Cannabinoids. Seriously. It does.

            Cannabinoids are chemical compounds. They are produced naturally in

            The human body produces Endocannabinoids (endo means ‘within’, as in
            within the body), just like cannabis and some other plants produce
            phytocannabinoids (<em>Phyto</em> – meaning ‘plant’). Our body also
            has receptors called CB1 and CB2 designed specifically to recognize
            and respond to our endogenous cannabinoids.

            Great question, really. For starters, it has way too many syllables.
            But it’s similar to how research on morphine led to the discovery of
            endogenous morphine-like chemicals, which we know as endorphins
            (‘endo’ meaning). And our bodies have endogenous cannabinoids and
            cannabinoid receptors. So, it was named the Endocannabinoid System,
            or ECS, which is a network of receptors throughout the body that
            interact with cannabinoids.

            The human body's ECS is responsible for maintaining balance and
            regulating essential functions like sleep, mood, and memory. The ECS
            relies on the natural production of endogenous cannabinoids in order
            to function properly. Sometimes we need to supplement our endogenous
            cannabinoids with cannabinoids from external sources, such as CBD
            Cannabidiol. When you ingest CBD, it stimulates the ECS which in
            turn helps to restore balance and maintain homeostasis.

            Hemp is a form of cannabis (sativa). Marijuana and hemp are both
            members of the cannabis family. Like cousins, they do share some
            characteristics. However, they are not the same thing.
          </p>
          <p> Here’s their biggest difference:</p>
          <p>
            The amount of psychoactive Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) each plant
            produces. Hemp contains no more than 0.3 percent THC. Marijuana
            contains up to 30 percent THC. And that’s a big difference.
            Marijuana can get you really high, while hemp has such a low amount
            of THC, that it would be is impossible to get high off it.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because hemp has no psychoactive effects, the law has no problem
            with it. It’s legal.

            If we’re talking about hemp-derived CBD, then the answer is yes.
            Now, the keyword here is “hemp-derived.” Because CBD from hemp has
            no psychoactive effects, the purchase, sale, or possession of hemp
            CBD products are completely legal in all 50 states in the US.
            Because hemp is sometimes confused with the marijuana plant, there
            is still some stigma towards hemp-derived CBD, but from a legal
            perspective, hemp-derived CBD is completely legal and benefits from

            Most issues have concerned the companies manufacturing the CBD. As

            CBD is extracted from flowers, leaves, and the stalk of the hemp
            plant using solvents such as CO2, Ethanol and Olive Oil. During the
            extraction process, CBD is mixed with a carrier oil such as hemp
            seed oil or coconut oil. We extract CBD by keeping the THC content
            in the extraction far lower than 0.3%. Hence, the resulting CBD oil
            is legal in all 50 states in the U.S.

            Hemp growing conditions aren’t federally regulated, which makes it

            Knowing the growing conditions of the soil, overall environment, and

            Supercritical CO2 extraction is the most advanced extraction
            technique resulting in a safe, clean and high-quality CBD Oil.
            Solid, pressurized CO2 (dry ice) is pumped through the hemp
            extracting the oil. CO2 extraction prevents thermal degradation and
            helps retain more terpenes and cannabinoids in the oil. The result

            Ethanol solvent is run through the hemp plant material stripping it

            Olive oil extraction requires that the raw hemp plant is first
            heated (decarboxylated). Then, the olive oil is added and the
            mixture further heated to extract the cannabinoids. Olive oil cannot
            be evaporated away after the extraction. This process is simple and
            inexpensive, but the infused olive oil is highly perishable, and
            thus impractical for commercial CBD producers.

            Dosing is highly personalized and depends on age, weight, and many
            other factors. Whether ingesting oils or capsules, using a skin
            cream or edible items, the general guideline is to start with a low
            amount, gauge the effects and go slowly. Simply put, don’t go diving
            into the deep end. CBD dosing experiments have shown that small
            doses of CBD have a moderately ‘active’ effect, which means that a
            modest amount of CBD is better for focus than a higher amount.
            Interestingly, large dosages can have a slightly sedative effect.
            More research is needed to show exactly what is the optimal dosage
            for anti-anxiety and antidepressant effects. One can also experiment

            The key to taking CBD oil drops is to start out one drop at a time.
            And just as importantly, CBD Oil must be taken under the tongue and
            held there for 30 to 60 seconds. Why? Sublingual dosing is the
            fastest way for the active ingredients to absorb into the tiny blood
            vessels under the tongue. The capillaries under the tongue help
            carry the CBD oil into our bloodstream within 10-15 minutes. CBD in
            edibles and capsules can take about 45 minutes. Because of the high
            rate of absorption, this means that sublingual dosing is also the
            most cost-effective way to take CBD.

            It’s essential to combine CBD with healthy lifestyle choices. While
            CBD dosing advice is not legally allowed it is reasonable to start
            with a small does (say, a 1 ml of CBD Oil 300 mg twice per day or a
            10 mg capsule twice per day) and then gradually increase the dose
            until you find your “sweet spot”. Many people use a microdosing
            technique to find their personal dosage and adjust it as needed over
            time. The quantity of CBD that works for one person may be quite
            different for another. It can depend on a number of factors
            including age, weight and personal health conditions. If the low
            dose does not provide any results, try increasing it gradually over
            a week or two weeks or sometimes a couple of months. You may find it
            helpful to use a journal to log your results. Keep track of how much
            you’ve taken, how you feel before dosing and at several time
            intervals afterward, and any changes in symptoms that you notice.
            Some people may just require a higher dose and that can be you. The
            only way to find out is to be patient and continue with the CBD for
            a little more time. The long-term benefits associated with CBD
            require appropriate dosing for a minimum of one to two months.

              confirmed after step 4.

              If your appointment is accepted, you’ll be charged in full for the
              appointment. If the doctor declines the request or doesn’t respond
              within 24 hours, no charge is made and you can make an appointment
              with someone else.

              While extremely rare, if a doctor needs to cancel an appointment,
              you'll be notified as soon as the cancellation is reported. You’ll
              be refunded in full.

              We take doctor cancellations very seriously. If your doctor
              cancels, they may receive a fine or their ratings on the site
              would be reduced, outside of accepted exceptions and pending a
              review of their account.

              will be refunded according to our cancellation policy.

            Consult is not intended to replace your primary care doctor, but
            simply to provide you with access to doctors with expertise in
            Medical Cannabis and CBD. They are well-versed in the medical use of
            CBD and can provide comprehensive guidance regarding CBD dosing and
            potential drug interactions. You should not use Consult if you are
            experiencing a medical emergency. In case of a medical
            life-threatening emergency, you should dial 911 immediately.
